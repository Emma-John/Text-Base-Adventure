# Overview

This is a program I wrote as I was exploring Java for the first time. This is a text based adventure with character creation, monster generation, and a battle system. I had lots of fun while learning about Java and using it to make this little game.

# Development Environment

I used Java to make this program possible. The object oriented program make this game easier to program.

I also used java.lang.Math library for the random number generator and the java.util.Scanner libaray for all of the user imput.


# Useful Websites

Here are some websites I used to assist me learning Java:

# Future Work

Here are some things I would live to add/improve on:

- I would love to add in items and a rarity system using a binary tree
- Finess the battle system to include different options of attacks/abilities
- Finish out the story and incorporate a save function
